            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p>I am a 18-year-old boy from Peru who one day made the decision to study programming. I have always wanted to know how a computer works and how social media was created. Now, I love this world, and am so glad to have made a right decision.</p>

                <h3>Front-End Developer</h3>
                <p>I am an expert in programming in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Also, I know how to really use some frameworks such as React and Angular. I have taken some courses to learn more about these technologies, and now I am ready to demostrate how much I have learnt.</p>

                <h3>Back-End Developer</h3>
                <p>I also consider myself as a Back-End Developer, because I could have taken some courses about PHP and Data Bases to be able to program the Back-End of some project I have thought before. Nonetheless, if I had to chose between being a Front-End Developer or being a Back-End Developer, I would chose to be a Front-End Developer because it is what I like more and spent more time studying.</p>
